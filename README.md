# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction App

A **Streamlit-based Machine Learning application** that predicts wine quality based on physicochemical properties.  
Built using the **Wine Quality Dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, this project demonstrates the complete ML workflow — from data preprocessing to cloud deployment.

## 📊 Dataset Description

- **Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository – Wine Quality Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality)
- **Shape:** `1599 rows × 12 columns` (red wine data)
- **Features:**
  - Fixed acidity
  - Volatile acidity
  - Citric acid
  - Residual sugar
  - Chlorides
  - Free sulfur dioxide
  - Total sulfur dioxide
  - Density
  - pH
  - Sulphates
  - Alcohol
- **Target:** Wine quality score (0–10)

**Rationale for Selection:**  
The dataset offers real-world tabular data with balanced features and a clear predictive target, making it ideal for demonstrating an **end-to-end ML workflow**.

## 🛠 Data Preprocessing

- Checked dataset **shape** and **structure**.
- Verified **no missing values**.
- Removed **duplicate rows** to ensure data integrity.
- Standardized feature scales for improved model performance.
- Split into **training** and **testing sets** for evaluation.

## 🤖 Model Selection & Evaluation

- **Model Used:** Random Forest Classifier (selected for its accuracy and robustness with tabular data).
- **Hyperparameters:** Tuned using **GridSearchCV** to optimize tree depth, number of trees, and split criteria.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.
- **Best Accuracy Achieved:** ~90% on the test set.
